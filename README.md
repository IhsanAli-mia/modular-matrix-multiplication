Just a small lightweight tool I made to enable modular matrix multiplication, for usecases such as when you work with binary codes. Feel free to use if it helps you out.

### Instructions

```
[git clone ](https://github.com/IhsanAli-mia/modular-matrix-multiplication.git)
cd modular-matrix-multiplication
python app.py
```

Happy multiplying!
